ILUGC was started on 1997 and it is an one of the oldest Linux Users
Group in India. We are a heterogeneous group of computer users from
the South Indian city of
[Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai) (aka Madras), united
in our use of Free/Libre/Open Source Softwares and support of Software
Freedom in general and the GNU/Linux in particular. Most of our
monthly meetings see a technical talk, not necessarily on GNU/Linux
but also on FSF/GNU/OSS/BSD related topics such as Perl, Python, PHP,
FreeBSD, TCP, IP, etc,.
