### Talk Details

#### Talk 1

**Topic**: Emacs Prelude

**Description**: Emacs Prelude is a distribution that enhances the default
Emacs experience. In this talk, we will address the installation,
configuration and usage of Prelude for beginners as well as for power
users. It has a simple architecture and is compatible with GNU Emacs
25.1+. Although it comes with a pre-defined set of packages, it also
provides an easy way for customization.

**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Speaker Full Name**: Shakthi Kannan

**About Speaker**: A Free Software enthusiast.

#### Talk 2

**Topic**: Two uses for Single board computers

**Description**: Single board computers (SBCs), like the Raspberry Pi, are
ideal for running 24/7 because of their low power usage. Applications
that need to run all the time, could be run on an SBC.

In this talk, I'll discuss setting up 2 such applications on the Raspberry pi:
1. IRC bounce server (ZNC)
2. Pi-hole (an application that blocks ads network-wide)

Though I'll be using a Raspberry Pi for demonstration, the tools (znc
and pi-hole) would work on any SBC that can run Linux.

**Duration**: 40-60 Minutes

**Speaker Full Name**: Abdun Nihaal

**About Speaker**: Student pursuing MS in Computer Science
