Considering the events [unfolding](https://lwn.net/Articles/857252/) in [freenode.net](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/). We will be moving our **#ilugc** channel from [freenode.net](https://freenode.net) to [libera.chat](https://libera.chat), closing the existing **#ilugc** channel in freenode.net.

Already **https://meet.ilugc.in** switched over to **irc.libera.chat**. So, if you join the **#ilugc** channel from **https://meet.ilugc.in**, then you will not face any problem.

I hope everyone will join us through **#ilugc** from **irc.libera.chat** (this is the old freenode from 2002 who supported FOSS communities for all these years).
