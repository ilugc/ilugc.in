#### Talk 1

**Topic**: Interception tools 

**Description**: In this talk, I'll discuss about interception tools, a set of utilities that allows us to create keyboard remappings that work across Xorg, wayland and even the TTY.

It can be used to do more than just remapping. For example, Caps2Esc tool makes the Caps lock key behave linux user like the Escape key

if pressed and released, but if the key is pressed along with another key, it behaves like the Control key.

We will see how these tools work and also look at how we can write our own interception tool for our custom functionality.
