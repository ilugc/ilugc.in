#### Talk 2

**Topic**: Profiling with BPFTrace

**Description**:
BPF is a kernel feature that allows us to monitor some events
happening inside the Linux kernel.

It was initially used for packet filtering. But it has been extended
into an observability and profiling tool.

BPF can be used to answer questions like
- What is the average latency of a particular kernel function?
- How many times does a system call get called in a time interval?
- What is the stack trace when inside a particular kernel function?

BPFtrace is a tool that makes it easier to write BPF code.
In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to BPF and show a demo of
using BPFtrace for tracing.

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Speaker Name**: Abdun Nihaal

**About Speaker**: I'm a student pursuing M.S. at IITM.
