* importance of pwd command, current working directory
* overview of unix filesystem, directories files
* the `/` directory
* home directory
* `ls` command, `-l` option to ls command
* `everything in unix is a file` philosophy
* `cd` command
* three types of commands, regular, built-in, aliases with example
* importance of `PATH` variable
* `which` command
* `stat` command
