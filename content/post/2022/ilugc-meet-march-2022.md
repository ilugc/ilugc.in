### Talk Details

#### Talk 0

**Topic**: Coccinelle

**Description**: When working with large code bases, we may come across
situations where the same change has to be applied in multiple
instances across the code base. For example, if an API function
changes, we have to update all calls to that function, to reflect the
new API. Coccinelle is a tool to automate such changes across a C/C++
code base. In this talk, I'll discuss what Coccinelle is, how to use
it and discuss how it is being used in the Linux kernel.

**Duration**: ~ 40 minutes\
