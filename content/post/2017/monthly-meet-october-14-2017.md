* Speaker: T Shrinivasan
* Duration: 1 hour 
* Description:
Recently, we found ways to install Tamill TTS provided by IITM donlab
We are dreaming about Maps in Tamil, for long time.

Imagine your mobile phone or GPS device, shows the maps in Tamil,
displays the roads, interesting places in Tamil, It shows routes and
says the street names and directions in Tamil while driving.

The dream can come into real as we have most of the required technologies.
OpenStreetMaps to provide maps, many apps like streetcomplete,
osmcontribute to add streetname and interesting places, Tamil TTS to
say everything in tamil.

The major thing we need is we need all the strings in Tamil.
OSM supports language tags and we can give any string in any language,
along with its translation on other languages.

To enable the translation process of existing strings in OSM, we are
working on a telegram bot. Now, it is easy to contribute to OSM via
translation, with mobile or with web browser.

The bot will be released for public tomorrow with its source code.

It will ask for your osm username, and  then for translate or verify.
The strings will be translated by google translator as first step.
That is not perfect fully. so, we need people to verify it,

You can see a string with its translation. Then say it right or wrong.
once three people confirmed a string it as right, it will be
confirmed. The incorrect strings will be displayed for translation.

Once the strings are completed, they will be uploaded to OSM using a
bot account.

Will release the bot tomorrow.

Come with
your smartphone.
Install Indic Keyboard or Sellinam for Tamil Typing.
Register at openstreetmaps.org

Let us have a translation workshop for openstreetmaps.org

Thanks for the team.
