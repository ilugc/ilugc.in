It was a small gathering this time.

* Magesh spoke about his recent experience trying to disable typographic
ligatures on Xubuntu
* Gautham spoke about his experience with Lubuntu and how it consumed less
resources and made it possible to use his old hardware
* Magesh addressed a question from the audience (from a IIT EEE faculty, I
don't remember his name, sorry) about VirtualBox and how it's able to
provide a way to transfer operating system between different hardware
configurations.
* It was followed by a question/discussion from the same person about if
GPU can be made available within a virtual machine. Discussion touched upon
the topic of integrated and dedicated GPU and how linux has some way to go
to offer seamless GPU switching/support for end users.
* Then a smaller group continued casual discussions at the canteen.

Thanks Akash/friends (Jaya Engg college) for sponsoring refreshments.
