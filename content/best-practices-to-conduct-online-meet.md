## Conducting Online IRC Meeting - Best Practices

we encourage participants to follow these simple steps to conduct the IRC meet effectively,

* Please watch what others are doing and do not interrupt
* If you have a question, type "?" and wait for your time to ask, the speaker who is conducting the talk will call your name to ask a question.
* If you need to speak, type "!" and wait for your time to speak.
* If you're done speaking, type "eof"
* If you agree with someone, type "nickname: +1", here nickname is who you are agreeing with.
